# Restaurant Locator - by Algolia

[Live link](http://drstonebraker.github.io/restaurant-search)

This repo contains a project assigned to me by Algolia as a part of their recruitment process.

## Technologies
This app features as-you-type search with the Algolia API.

The application was built using React.js, and deployed using tools made available by create-react-app.  It also has basic Progressive Web App features.

## Data source
The data source provided for the assignment was split between a CSV file and JSON file.

I wrote a script to combine the data into [a single JSON file](https://github.com/drstonebraker/restaurant-search/blob/master/src/resources/dataset/merge_script.rb) with the relevant attributes.

## Customer Questions
The assignment also featured a prompt to respond to a series of support questions from Algolia clients.
